# Json2BakinPlugin
This is an RPG BAKIN dll plugin to convert RPG Maker MV (probably MZ as well) JSON map data to BAKIN event sheet scripts.<BR>
Due to the conceptual differences of event structures between RPG Maker and BAKIN, not all event commands are properly converted to BAKIN commands.<BR>
There're a number of RPG Maker MV commands that has no corresponding BAKIN commands. Those commands are exported as comment texts.<BR>
Currently Japanese version only.
